## My process
  - This was little bit technical for me . I first used css grid to template properties to create the 2 section of the design . All bound to one main grid container.
  - In the left container i displayed all items to flex direction column and and justified the items to space around so they dont touch the baseline of the container.
  - In the right container i did same but created an inners container to carry the results and the button only.
  - The header (Summary) is out of this container 
### Built with
